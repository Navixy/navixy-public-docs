# Custom fields

Custom fields allow you to add personalized information to the description of places. Custom fields operate in the same way as standard fields, allowing you to store valuable data that can be used for filtering and improving operational efficiency.

**Examples:**

* In **Field service** management, custom fields can supplement information about visited Places. A field employee using the [X-GPS Tracker](https://x-gps.app/) mobile application can view and edit detailed information about Places, such as customer details and service requirements, enhancing task completion.

## FAQs and troubleshooting

* **Can I fill in Custom fields from CRM systems via Navixy API?** Yes, you can fill custom fields in Navixy by making API calls to synchronize data from your CRM. This enables seamless data transfer and updates, ensuring that all information is up-to-date and accessible in both systems.
